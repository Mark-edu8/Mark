### BITCOIN

An interesting situation saw the cryptocurrency establish support at $76.7K support on Friday, only to retrace the majority of last weeks losses over the weekend and start the week at $94.3K - Blockchain affording traders 24/7 trading access. The weekend reversal was short lived as sellers once again took control  with continued downward pressure to establish support at $85.1K. Sellers will look below $80K, while buyers look up to $90K. Technically the trend is down, bias is down and sentiment appears to favours the downside.
