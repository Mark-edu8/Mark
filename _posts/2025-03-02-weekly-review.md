### USD INDEX

The USD broke a 3 week losing streak and bounced up off the 106 support to close at 107.50. Note the strong support level matches the 38.2% fib retracement from the preceding uptrend which ran from 100 up to 110 over the last quarter of 2024. Further technical relevance is that the support level is the previous resistance from April 2024. Buyers will look up to 108, while sellers will aim below 107.

### S&P 500

Although buyers closed the week on the front foot, the trend is down and the red weekly candlestick confirms the inverse relationship with the U$. The 5840 area has proved to be a strong support since late 2024 and buyers will be looking to add to Fridays 5968 close and aim to retake the pivotal 6000 mark.

### GOLD

Following 8 consecutive weeks of green candlesticks and consistent record highs culminating in a new $2954 resistance level, last week saw sellers step in and set weekly support at $2835. Technically the double top and engulfing close signals further selling to follow. The contradiction is that surely the metal has not lost its safe haven status and should there still be demand for gold, buyers may well see this as a new opportunity on the way to reaching the $3000 mark. Buyers will target $2900 as the first upside target, while sellers look below $2800.

### BRENT OIL

The 7 week downtrend continued with a series of lower highs and lower lows, with support now standing at $71.91. Sellers will be looking at the $70 level as the next downside target, while buyers look to maintain above $73, on the way to testing $74.70 resistance. Global geopolitical uncertainty could have an effect on supply concerns which would create demand and see buyers look to reverse the sentiment which has been in place through 2025 during the Trump presidency.

### BITCOIN

In a huge selloff last week the cryptocurrency, which had been hovering sideways in a gentle downtrend dropped almost $20K from $96.7K down to $78.2K. Buyers stood on the sidelines as sellers controlled the activity all through the week. However, with crypto trading and blockchain accessibility allowing for 24/7 trading, buyers have rallied today (March 2) and prices are back up to the $94K area to start the new trading week. Buyers will be looking above $97K while sellers will look below $90K to resume last week's selloff.
