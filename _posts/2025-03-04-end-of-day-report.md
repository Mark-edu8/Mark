<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> Sellers were relentless in establishing the yearly low at 105.44 as buyers stood on the sidelines. From a technical perspective buyers stepped in at these levels in Dec 2024, however the fundamentals are very different in the new Trump era. While sellers will look down at the 105 area, buyers will see 106 as the first upside target.


<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> Although buyers did step in at the 5744 support level, the bias, trend and sentiment were all down in the major equity index.Sellers have tried unsuccessfully  to break and maintain below support  3 times since late last year. Interestingly the inverse relationship between S&P and the USDX has not played out as both instruments move downwards in the same direction.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> The traditional inverse relationship between USD and gold played out with the metal adding to yesterdays gains and trading comfortably above the $2900 mark. Buyers continue to express demand for golds safe haven status with $2950 resistance again being eyed on the upside. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> A game of 2 halves saw sellers establish support at $69.75 during the Asian and European sessions, while buyers took over in the US session and reversed the earlier losses to close at $71.12 in volatile trading. The $70 level looks pivotal as buyers aim to maintain above $71 while sellers look to add to the strong downtrend on the daily and weekly charts

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> Following an early selloff, buyers regained control in the US session to close relatively close to where the day started in the $87K area. Buyers eye a break above $90K while sellers look to retest the $81K support.
