<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> A strong day for the USD as the index broke above the descending trendline, reversing the downtrend and in so doing broke the succession of lower highs. Buyers established resistance at 107.21 as demand for U$ did not wane throughout the trading day. The next goal on the upside sits at 108, while sellers will look below 107 as the first downside target.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> The stark inverse relationship between equities and the USD was highlighted by the S&P establishing support at 5875, matching the lows last seen in early January. While sellers look to add to the selloff, buyers will look up to 6000, the previous pivot level which now looks a long way up. Today was the 6th straight day of losses as panic looks to be setting in, and that now puts 5800 clearly in sight.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> It appears that expected profit taking and a natural retracement has developed into a strong downtrend as buyers stood on the sidelines while sellers pushed the metal further down to $2866. The selloff highlighted the traditional inverse relationship between gold and USD. Buyers will look up to $2900 as a first goal on the upside, while sellers look to extend the downtrend.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> Buyers stepped in with a marked bounce up off the $72 support area and established resistance at $73.75. Next upside target sits at $74, on the way to challenging the $74.75 mark. Sellers will aim below to test $73 on the downside.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> After buyers and sellers tested a move in both directions, price action ended alongside where it started, reflected in a daily doji-like candlestick. Support was set at $82.5K, with resistance established at $86.9K. Buyers will aim for $90K as a first step in reversing the downtrend, while sellers aim below $82K on the downside.
