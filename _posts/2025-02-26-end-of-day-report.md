<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> Buyers stepped in at the 106 support area for the 3rd consecutive day, erasing a portion of the selloff from yesterday. Although the brief move up resulted in a green daily candle, sellers will see yesterdays high adding to a series of lower highs on the daily charts. Both the trend and bias remain down as negative USD sentiment continues. While sellers look below 106, buyers aim at 106.72 on the upside

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> After a gap up to start the day, sellers picked up from where they left off and added to the 5 day downtrend establishing support at 5945.Noteworthy that the bias is down in both USDX and S&P, not in keeping with the traditional inverse relationship between the two indices. Sellers will be aiming below 5925, while buyers look above the 6000 level.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> Sellers started the session by retesting support at $2890, however buyers stepped in to close the session back where it started at $2917, with a doji-like candle confirming the indecision. Noteworthy from a technical standpoint that todays fight back cancelled out 2 consecutive down days. It appears that profit taking and uncertainty played a role in the move lower rather than a lack of demand for golds safe haven status. 

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> Sellers added to yesterdays selloff establishing a  lower low and new support at $71.91. A lack of demand and seemingly little supply concerns, buyers continue to stand on the sidelines. Sellers will aim to maintain below $72, while buyers look up to resistance at $72.82 being the first upside target.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> Not only did sellers continue the push lower, they were relentless in setting support at $82.1K. Thats a $17.6K move lower since last week Friday. Todays move alone completed a $9K daily range! The sell-off is reminiscent of the Trump election rally we saw in November 2024.
