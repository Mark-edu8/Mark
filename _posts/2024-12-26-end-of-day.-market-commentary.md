### USD INDEX. 

Bias remains up. Buyers stepped aside, although sellers did not step in. Prices closed the same as pre-Christmas. Buyers look above 108 while sellers look down at 107.50.

### GOLD. 

The bias is up as buyers stepped in - all be it that demand was slight. Next target on the upside is $2650 while sellers look back down to the $2620 area. USDX direction will determine the XAU trend.

### BRENT OIL. 

Price action remains contained between $72.50 and $73.50. Buyers aim at $74 while sellers aim at $72. Interesting technical perspective with today?s red candle having a slightly higher high and higher low on the daily charts.

### BITCOIN. 

Sellers dominated and brough prices down from $100K, to close a typical daily $5K trading range at $95K. Demand was limited. Buyers will look to retake $96K while sellers look down at $92K. Note we have not had a close below $95K since Nov 26th
