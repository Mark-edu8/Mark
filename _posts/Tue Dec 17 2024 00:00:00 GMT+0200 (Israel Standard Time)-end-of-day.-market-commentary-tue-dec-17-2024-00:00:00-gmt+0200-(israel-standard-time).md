## GOLD. 
### BRENT OIL. 
Oil is trading in a range between $72.5 and $74.5. The bias is down with buyers and sellers continuing to trade the range as opposed to establish a meaningful trend in either direction. Sellers did test below $73 today, and then buyers stepped in to close at $73.29.


### BITCOIN. 
Another day, another record high at $108200. Demand prevails at these record high levels as sellers wonder when the top will be in place. Buyers look up at $110K while sellers look down at $105.5 as being the first target on the downside.
