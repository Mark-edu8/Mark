### USD INDEX

Sellers continued to dominate price action as the index moved lower for the 3rd consecutive week with a series of lower highs and lower lows confirming the downtrend. Support at 106.21 is only slightly above the first fib retracement level of 106.11 measured from the preceding uptrend . The downward bias reflects the negative sentiment surrounding the USD. While sellers look below 106, buyers will aim to retake weekly resistance level of 107.28 on the upside.

### S&P 500

Sellers prevailed over the week, although technically there are contradictions. There is no lower low on the charts, and the record high resistance level at 6165 reflects the 3rd attempt for buyers to break higher and initiate the equity index's traditional invers e relationship with the USD. Sellers will look below 6000, while buyers aim above 6100 on the upside.

### GOLD

The metal continued its rally for the 8th consecutive week and set a new record high at $2957. The classic uptrend, with a series of higher highs and higher lows confirms the demand for gold as a safe haven with geopolitical uncertainty and a negative sentiment towards the USD contributing to the demand . Buyers are eyeing the $3000 mark while seller s have been unwilling to add to brief sessions of profit taking as buyers step in at every opportunity to join the march higher.

### BRENT OIL

Sellers succeeded in establishing a lower low for the 6th consecutive week. Support stands at $73.84 , a dramatic sell -off since the $81.65 resistance we saw at the start of the year. Sellers will aim below $73 with an eye on the $70 level from Sept 2024. Buyers have been unable to fight back as an apparent lack of supply concerns translates to a lack of demand.

### BITCOIN

The doji -like candle reflect s the lack of direction with neither buyers or sellers able to sustain a break above $97K on the upside, or below $95K on the downside. Every attempt lower has been met with buyers stepping in at the lower $90K area , while sellers do the same as price action approaches the psychological $100K area. Although the charts reflect the sideways activity , the bias has a downward feel and technically the EMAs confirm a downtrend.
