### USD INDEX

The USD took a beating this past week as sellers drove the index down to 103.36 support from the high at 107.47. A cooling in terms of economic data releases, technical confirmation of a strong downtrend and negative sentiment surrounding the world reserve currency all added to buyers standing on the sidelines. Buyers looking for a bounce will aim at 104 as the first upside target.

### S&P 500

Sellers dominated for the 3rd straight week and in so doing matched the 5670 support area which was last reached in November 2024. Noteworthy that the equity index is moving downward in the same direction as the USDX, as opposed to the traditional inverse relationship between the two indices. Buyers did fight back on Friday to close at 5762and will be looking up at 5800 on the upside.

### GOLD

The metal recouped much of the previous weeks selloff and the uptrend from the start of the year remains intact. The weekly low sits at $2857 with resistance set at $2933. While price ranges have been relatively limited the bias remains up and sentiment favours the upside. Golds safe haven status appears to be intact notwithstanding the limited demand. The $2900 levels look pivotal and buyers have maintained closing prices in the $1920 area.

### BRENT OIL

Aside from Fridays attempted bounce, sellers have dominated price action with a succession of lower lows and lower highs adding to the strong downtrend. The weeks red candlestick is the 8th consecutive week of down candles. The support at 68.14 is matching the September 2024 low from where buyers retook $80 - the starting point of the current downtrend. Tariffs, trade wars and lack of supply concerns are all contributing to the selloff. Buyers will target $71.22 as first upside target.

### BITCOIN

It appears to be looking difficult for buyers to regain above $90K with the $100K mark looking  further away than does the $80K level. Although sellers remain cautious of buyers stepping in, the overall feel and sentiment appears to be bearish and the bullish sentiment from last years pre election rally has lost the optimism created by the Trumps crypto rhetoric. Buyers will look at the weekly high of $87K while sellers aim below $80K.
