<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> After a brief push lower and testing the 38.2% fib retracement level measured from the preceding uptrend (106 support ), buyers fought back establishing daily resistance at 106.61. The move higher was in keeping with the inverse relationship between equities and the U$. Notwithstanding the green candlestick, lower lows and lower highs confirm the downtrend .

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> In keeping with the inverse relationship between the USD and S&P , the index moved sharply down and extended the downtrend for the 3rd consecutive day. Sellers broke the pivotal 6000 level as buyers stood on the sidelines. Next target on the downside sits a t 5950, while buyers look up to regain the 6100 mark .

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> Technically the metal set a record high at $2956, while practically price action remained at the $2950 resistance area. In what has become a familiar pattern, sellers made the early move and set support at $2920, only for buyers to step in and confirm demand for gold's safe haven status. The $3000 mark remains the upside target while sellers aim below $2900 to initiate any potential reversal .

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> Although buyers did step in at the $73.65 support level, the fight back was timid and resistance stands at $74.44, a long way off the $76.72 resistance. While sellers aim to retest below $74 on the downside, buyers will look at $75 on the upside .

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> A significant push lower saw sellers test the $93K support without any resistance from buyers. Note the descending trendline which held up as the resistance level and stopped any attempt at moving higher. This current support is the level that buyers have stepped in on previous tests of the low $90K area, as sellers now look to test and break below $90K. The $94K mark will be the first upside target in an attempt to reverse today's losses.
