### USD INDEX

A 4th consecutive red candlestick, but only just as buyers stepped in at the 103.33 support and in so doing gave us a double bottom (Nov 2024) to signal a bounce up, or perhaps potential reversal on the daily charts.Buyers will aim above 104 while sellers may see the pause as nothing more than a natural retracement.

### S&P 500

After taking a one day breather sellers resumed control and erased all of yesterdays gains.The downtrend continued with support established at 5773 and the yearly low of 5744 again being in view. As is becoming more common, the S&P and USDX are not displaying the more traditional inverse relationship between the 2 indices.

### GOLD

For the 3rd consecutive day the metal has traded within a narrow $30 range between $2889 and $2919, closing with a doji like candlestick around the $2910 area. While the trend is slightly down, the sentiment and bias have a positive feel as prices maintain above $2900 and golds safe haven status continues to hold appeal

### BRENT OIL

Neither buyers nor sellers were able to hold on to attempted moves in either direction with a doji like daily candlestick confirming the indecision. Notwithstanding, the strong downtrend is firmly intact as sellers remain close to the $68.36 support area. The lack of demand at current levels favours the downside with buyers looking up to regaining the $70 level.

### BITCOIN

A relatively narrow trading range for the cryptocurrency between $87.7K and $91K with no clear direction established. Looking at the bigger picture, buyers aim to test above $95K while sellers aim below $85K. It appears that it will take a fundamental reason, rather than technical to initiate a real move - surely a Trump endorsement would give buyers the edge here.
