<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> The downtrend gained momentum as sellers added to yesterdays selloff on the way to establishing support at 103.84. While trend, bias and sentiment all point downward, buyers will note the RSI signalling an oversold number at 28. The 104 mark would be the first upside target while sellers look at 103.25, the low from Sept 2024.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> In keeping with the traditional inverse relationship between equities and the USD, buyers added to yesterdays bounce up off 5744 support and in so doing produced a green candlestick on the daily chart. Buyers will aim at 6000 to confirm a reversal while sellers look to retest the established support area. Noteworthy that this was the 3rd failed attempt by sellers to maintain below 5750.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> A dojilike daily candlestick confirmed the indecision between buyers and sellers as price action resulted in a close alongside the $2918 open price. While the safehaven status of gold has prevented sellers from adding to last weeks selloff, buyers have been held up at the $2927 resistance area. Sentiment, demand  and a weak USD may well see buyers retest the $2750 record high from late last month.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> Selling pressure continued as a lack of supply concerns coupled with tariffs and trade war uncertainty have kept buyers at bay as significant levels on the downside have been broken. Support now sits at $68.36. While buyers will look up to $69 as the first upside target, sellers may be wary of trading below the $70 level. Note RSI signalling oversold numbers below 30.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> Buyers added to yesterdays gains and established resistance at $91K. However it does appear that price action has moved a leg lower and there has been more activity between $85K and $90K, as opposed to the $5K range between $90K and $95K. Note that current resistance levels acted as previous support in late 2024. While the EMAs signal a daily uptrend, sellers may see current resistance levels as a lower high when looking at the big picture.
