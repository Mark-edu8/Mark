<h2>Insights</h2>
<strong style="color: #2caef7;">USD INDEX</strong> The fightback was short lived as sellers again dominated price action and in so doing erased yesterday's gains. The downtrend continues as sentiment for U$ remains negative. Note the support area aligns with the 38.2% fib retracement level measured from the preceding uptrend. Sellers aim below 106 while buyers look up to 106.72 resistance.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">S&P 500</strong> Sellers continued from where they left off yesterday setting a new support at 5925. The downtrend continued for the 4th consecutive day, contributing to a "red day" across all the major instruments. Noteworthy that the index moved lower together with the weak USD, unlike the traditional inverse relationship between the 2 indices. Sellers will aim to retest 5900, while buyers look up to the 6000 level.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">GOLD</strong> Gold was also part of the overall selling fever today, with support established at $2887, before buyers fought back to close at $2914. Tomorrow will be a test of the metal's resilience as sellers have been unable to put 2 consecutive "down days" together since the start of the year. Sellers will aim to test the new support, while buyers first goal will be to maintain above $2900.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BRENT OIL</strong> A sharp move lower as sellers broke through the $74 support area, establishing daily support at $72.20, before going onto close at $72.66. While sellers will aim below $72, buyers will see $73 as the first target on the upside.

<strong style="color: #2caef7;">BITCOIN</strong> Downward pressure continued for the 2nd consecutive day as sellers broke below $90K and set support at $85.8K - a substantial $10K sell-off since yesterdays open. Noteworthy that the 38.2% fib retracement from $50K - $110K sits at $86K. Buyers stepped in at this level and will aim to regain $90K on the upside as a first target in an attempt to reverse the sharp move lower.
